# Lab10



Introduction:
In this lab, we used Python, pandas, matplotlib, and Streamlit to analyze water quality data. By
leveraging large language model (LLM) AI tools, we generated Python functions to filter and
visualize data for contaminants such as Escherichia coli, turbidity, and pH. We also built a full web
application that allows users to explore and visualize data interactively.
